AirBnB team project
AirBnB Clone; the console project.

This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration. All the files must be executable.
